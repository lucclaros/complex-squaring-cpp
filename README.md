# Function Overloading and Complex Number Squaring in C++

This C++ program demonstrates **function overloading** and **object-oriented programming** with complex numbers.  
It calculates the square of integers, floats, and complex numbers using three overloaded `CUAD` functions.

## Features
- Overloaded functions for `int`, `float`, and `COMPLEJO` types
- Complex number class with real and imaginary parts
- Displays results using standard output (`cout`)
- Demonstrates basic polymorphism

## Example usage
Square of 25 is 625
Square of 7.25 is 52.5625
Square of 8 + 14i is -132 + 224i
